# BigBrainALU
experimental research project on capacity theory of neural network

Mimicing bit flipping as a casual model, learning ALU caculation.

Experiment on the capacity reduction and generalization ability.

## Dataset
pipelining the dataset using tf.data API, Reading the data from sets fo files directly 


## Model building
toy models' training and saving result  
Standardized models' building process, gonna use dense network with decreasing size

Custom models' building process  
resnet?
piNN training  


Small task traning
3 bits dataset with ADD, SUB operations
